# PowerShell
General resources for PowerShell profile, prompt, and Visual Studio Code. 

## Prompt.ps1
Set a custom prompt that shows elevated status, username, history ID, and current path, followed by a > on a clean line. 

This makes it easy to cleanly find and copy commands that you have previously run while also clearly showing if the current session is elevated. Does not have any dependencies on additional modules. Put the contents of this script into your PowerShell profile or call this separate from your profile to make it set your prompt every time PowerShell loads.
