Welcome to my collection of PowerShell scripts, functions, snippets, prompts, and more. I have been adding new things regularly and slowing going through old code to make sure it's decent enough to share! ðŸ˜† Most of this will be focused on Active Directory, Entra ID, Exchange Server, Microsoft 365, and general PowerShell tooling. You never know what other nuggets we'll find here, though. Enjoy, and PRs are welcomed!
